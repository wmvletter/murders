We analyse US gun murder data collected by the FBI

dowload-data.R - downloads csv file to data directory

wrangle-date.R - creates a derived dataset and saves as R object in rda directory

analysis.R - generates a plot and saves it to the figs directory

########### In terminal ###########
cd ~    # move to home directory
mkdir projects    # make a new directory called projects
cd projects    # move to ~/projects directory
mkdir murders    # make new directory called murders inside of projects
cd murders    # move to ~/projects/murders/
mkdir data rda    # make two new directories, one is data the other is rda folder
ls    # to check if we indeed have one data folder and one rda folder
pwd    # check the current working directory
mkdir figs    # make a directory called figs to store figures
########## In RStudio ########
# pick existing directory as new project
getwd()    # to confirm current working directory
save()    # save into .rda file, .RData is also fine but less preferred
ggsave("figs/barplot.png")    # save a plot generated by ggplot2 to a dir called "figs"
